# Nifty Utils

This repository contains a number of useful utilties which are useful in most (if not all)
Rails applications.

We are just working to build this up and fully test & document the contents. All values should
be documented using RDoc syntax and can be output by running the command below from the root 
of the repository.

```
bundle exec sdoc
open doc/index.html
```
