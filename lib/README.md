# Nifty Utils

This repository contains a number of useful utilties which are useful in most (if not all)
Rails applications.

We are just working to build this up and fully test & document the contents.

### Active Record Extensions

* `inquirer(attribute, *values)` - allows you to quickly create boolean inquiry methods

### View Helpers

* `display_flash` - displays any flash output
* `gravatar(email, options)` - returns an image for an gravatar
